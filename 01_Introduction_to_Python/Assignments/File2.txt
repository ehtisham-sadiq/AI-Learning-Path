Data Science has become the most demanding job of the 21st century. 
Every organization is looking for candidates with knowledge of data science. 
In this tutorial, we are giving an introduction to data science, with data science Job roles, tools for data science, components of data science, application, etc.
Data science is a deep study of the massive amount of data, which involves extracting meaningful insights from raw, structured, and unstructured data that is processed using the scientific method, different technologies, and algorithms.
It is a multidisciplinary field that uses tools and techniques to manipulate the data so that you can find something new and meaningful.
Data science uses the most powerful hardware, programming systems, and most efficient algorithms to solve the data related problems. It is the future of artificial intelligence.
The machine learning expert is the one who works with various machine learning algorithms used in data science such as regression, clustering, classification, decision tree, random forest, etc.
Skill Required: Computer programming languages such as Python, C++, R, Java, and Hadoop. 
You should also have an understanding of various algorithms, problem-solving analytical skill, probability, and statistics.
