    "API stands for Application Programming Interface. An API is a software intermediary that allows two applications to talk to each other. When you use an application on your phone, the application connects to the Internet and sends data to a server. The server then processes the data and sends it back to your phone. The application on your phone then interprets the data and presents it to you in a readable way. \n",
    "\n",
    "An API is like a waiter in a restaurant. The waiter takes your order and sends it to the kitchen. The kitchen then prepares the food and sends it back to the waiter. The waiter then brings the food to you. \n",

    "## 1. What is FastAPI?\n",
    "\n",
    "FastAPI is a Python web framework designed for building APIs (Application Programming Interfaces). It is built on top of **Starlette** (for web handling) and **Pydantic** (for data validation and serialization). FastAPI is known for its speed, ease of use, and automatic generation of interactive API documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Features:\n",
    "- **High Performance**: FastAPI is one of the fastest Python web frameworks, thanks to its asynchronous capabilities.\n",
    "- **Automatic Validation**: FastAPI uses Python type hints to validate request data automatically.\n",
    "- **Automatic Documentation**: It generates interactive API documentation using Swagger UI and ReDoc.\n",
    "- **Asynchronous Support**: FastAPI supports asynchronous programming, making it ideal for modern web applications.\n",

    "### **Understanding a Layered Web Application Architecture**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Introduction**\n",
    "This is the architecture of a modern web application, focusing on how different layers interact to deliver a seamless user experience. We'll use a FastAPI-based application as an example, which includes a presentation layer, application layer, and data layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1. Presentation Layer (UI)**\n",
    "- **Purpose**: This is the user-facing part of the application where users interact with the system.\n",
    "- **Components**:\n",
    "  - **HTML**: The structure of the web pages that users see and interact with.\n",
    "- **Functionality**: \n",
    "  - Renders the user interface.\n",
    "  - Sends user inputs to the application layer for processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. Application Layer**\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Handles the core logic of the application, processes requests, and returns responses.\n",
    "- **Components**:\n",
    "  - **FastAPI**: A modern Python web framework used to build APIs quickly and efficiently.\n",
    "  - **Routing Logic**: Manages how incoming HTTP requests are directed to the appropriate handlers.\n",
    "  - **Pydantic Model**: Ensures data validation and settings management using Python type annotations.\n",
    "  - **REST API**: Exposes endpoints for clients to interact with the application using standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3. Data Layer**\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Manages data storage and retrieval.\n",
    "- **Components**:\n",
    "  - **SQLAlchemy ORM**: An Object-Relational Mapping tool that allows interaction with the database using Python objects.\n",
    "  - **ORM Model**: Represents database tables as Python classes.\n",
    "  - **Database**: In this case, MySQL is used as the relational database management system.\n",
    "  - **ORM Session, Engine & Connection**: Manages database connections and sessions, enabling the application to perform CRUD operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### **4. Key Entities and Interactions**\n",
    "- **Entities**:\n",
    "  - **User**: Represents users of the application.\n",
    "  - **Topic**: Represents topics or categories within the application.\n",
    "  - **Post**: Represents individual posts or content items.\n",
    "  - **Response**: Represents responses or replies to posts.\n",
    "- **Interactions**:\n",
    "  - **HTTP Methods**: \n",
    "    - **GET**: Retrieves data (e.g., fetching a user profile).\n",
    "    - **POST**: Submits data to be processed (e.g., creating a new post).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### **5. Application Structure**\n",
    "- **Files**:\n",
    "  - **main.py**: Contains the main application logic and routing.\n",
    "  - **database.py**: Handles database configuration and connection setup.\n",
    "  - **schema.py**: Defines data schemas using Pydantic for request and response validation.\n",
    "  - **model.py**: Contains the SQLAlchemy ORM models that map to database tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### **6. Workflow**\n",
    "1. **Client Request**: A user interacts with the UI, triggering an HTTP request (e.g., GET or POST).\n",
    "2. **Web Server**: The request is received by the web server, which routes it to the appropriate handler in the application layer.\n",
    "3. **Application Logic**: FastAPI processes the request, validates data using Pydantic, and interacts with the database via SQLAlchemy ORM.\n",
    "4. **Database Interaction**: SQLAlchemy ORM translates Python objects into SQL queries, interacts with the MySQL database, and retrieves or stores data.\n",
    "5. **Response**: The application layer sends a response back to the client, which is then rendered by the presentation layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **7. Benefits of This Architecture**\n",
    "- **Separation of Concerns**: Each layer has a distinct responsibility, making the application easier to manage and scale.\n",
    "- **Data Validation**: Pydantic ensures that data is valid before processing, reducing errors.\n",
    "- **Efficient Database Interaction**: SQLAlchemy ORM simplifies database operations and improves code readability.\n",
    "- **Scalability**: FastAPI's asynchronous capabilities allow the application to handle many requests efficiently.\n"

    "   def create_item(item: dict):\n",
    "       return {\"item\": item}\n",

    "   def update_item(item_id: int, item: dict):\n",

    "   def delete_item(item_id: int):\n",

    "### Different Parameters in FastAPI\n",
    "FastAPI supports several types of parameters to handle different types of data in your API:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Path Parameters**: These are part of the URL path and are used to identify a specific resource. For example:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   @app.get(\"/items/{item_id}\")\n",
    "   def read_item(item_id: int):\n",
    "       return {\"item_id\": item_id}\n",
    "   ```\n",

    "   ```python\n",
    "   @app.get(\"/items/\")\n",
    "   def read_items(skip: int = 0, limit: int = 10):\n",
    "       return {\"skip\": skip, \"limit\": limit}\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Request Body**: Used to send data to the server, typically in POST or PUT requests. FastAPI automatically validates and parses the request body using Pydantic models.\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   from pydantic import BaseModel\n",
    "\n",
    "   class Item(BaseModel):\n",
    "       name: str\n",

    "   def create_item(item: Item):\n",
    "       return {\"item\": item}\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Header Parameters**: Used to pass metadata in the HTTP headers. For example:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   from fastapi import Header\n",
    "\n",
    "   @app.get(\"/headers/\")\n",

    "       return {\"User-Agent\": user_agent}\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Cookie Parameters**: Used to read data from cookies sent by the client. For example:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   from fastapi import Cookie\n",
    "\n",
    "   @app.get(\"/cookies/\")\n",
