    "\n",
    "- A unique key in MySQL is a single field or combination of fields that ensure all values going to store into the column will be unique. It means a column cannot stores duplicate values. For example, the email addresses and roll numbers of students in the \"student_info\" table or contact number of employees in the \"Employee\" table should be unique.\n",
