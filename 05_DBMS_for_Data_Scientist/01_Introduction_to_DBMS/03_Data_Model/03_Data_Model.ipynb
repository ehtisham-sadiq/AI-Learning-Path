    "# What is Data Model?\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you have a small library and you want to keep track of the books you have in stock. Without a data model, you might just have a list of all the books and their information such as title, author, and number of pages. But with a data model, you can organize your data in a more structured way.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, you could create a relational database with two tables: one for books and one for authors. The books table would have columns for the title, number of pages, and the author's name. The authors table would have columns for the author's name and contact information.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can set up a relationship between the two tables by linking the author's name in both tables. So, when you want to know the contact information of the author of a specific book, you can easily find it by looking up the author's name in the authors table.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, you can also set consistency constraints, such as the author's name must be in proper format, or the number of pages must be a positive number.\n",
    "\n",
    "By using a data model, you can effectively organize your data in a way that makes it easy to understand and query, helping you to better manage your library's book collection.\n",

    "\n",

    "This is determined when designing a database by first deciding on the entities, then the relationship between them. For example, a database for a company could have entities such as employee, department, project, etc. The degree of the relationship between these entities is defined as the total number of entities involved in that relationship. This can be visualized in an E-R diagram, which shows the relationship between entities in a database's design. The E-R diagram uses symbols such as rectangles for entities, ovals for attributes, and diamonds for relationships.\n",
