    "# Extended ER Features?\n",
    "\n",
    "> In Entity-Relationship (ER) modeling, extended ER features such as specialization and generalization allow modeling of more complex relationships between entities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specialization represents a subtype-supertype relationship where a subtype is a specialized form of a supertype. For example, consider a company that has both permanent and contract employees. Here, the supertype \"Employee\" can be specialized into \"Permanent Employee\" and \"Contract Employee.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Generalization, on the other hand, represents a supertype-subtype relationship where a supertype is a generalized form of one or more subtypes. For example, consider a company that has both employees and customers. Here, the subtypes \"Employee\" and \"Customer\" can be generalized into the supertype \"Person.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "By using these extended ER features, it is possible to capture the complex relationships between entities, leading to a more accurate and detailed representation of the data. This can lead to better decision making and increased efficiency in processing and retrieving data.\n",

    "Just think about it if you create a person entity and use multiple attributes like `Salary` , `Profile Pic`, `Name` , `Contact` , `Address` , `Contact ID` the complexity of the entity will increase and it will be difficult to manage the data. So, we can create a new entity called `Employee` and use the attributes of the \"Person\" entity in the \"Employee\" entity. This is called Specialisation. So It is better to use some extended ER features to model the DB Schema.\n",

    "## Aggregation\n",
    "\n",
    "> Aggregation in DBMS(Database Management System) is a process of combining two or more entities that cannot be used alone, to form a more meaningful entity. When a single entity alone doesn't make sense on its own in a relationship then the aggregation process is done and the relationship of two entities acts as one entity after the aggregation has been done. Let's consider a classic example to understand the aggregation in DBMS.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:** Consider the above structure, and let's take an example of an employee and his manager, and the employee working on a project that his manager also manages. In a real scenario, you know that a manager not only manages the employees under them but also manages the work undertaken by the employees and the project. As discussed in the above example, if the \"Manager\" makes a relationship - \"manages\" with either the \"Employee\" or \"Project\" entity alone, then it will not make any sense because a manager has to manage both the employee as well as the project. Similarly, it can be said that if a single entity cannot derive results alone, then it can be aggregated with another entity to form a meaningful relationship. So, in this case, a new relationship is formed between the two entities, \"Employee\" and \"Project\"; the relationship between the two entities acts as one entity. In the given example, the relationship \"Builds\" between the two entities - \"Employee\" and \"Project\" acts as one entity that has the relationship \"Manages\" with the manager.\n",

    "\n",
    "- At times, the database might contain some entities which are less important, such as two or more entities that can be used to create a relationship with one another. This aggregation process helps to create more meaningful entities which can derive great results.\n",
    "- When the ER (Entity - Relationship model) is not able to represent the relationship between any of the present entities in the system then that particular entity can be used to create a new relationship with the other entity. The resultant entity can be used to create a relationship in the Entity-Relationship model.\n",
    "- When the DBMS has no complex entities but only trivial entities which are not upgradable in the database management system, then it is not possible for future upgrades. In this situation, two or more trivial entities can be used to create a new relationship between these entities and the resultant can be formed as a new complex entity.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "When using data in the form of numerical values, the following operations can be used to perform DBMS aggregation:\n",
    "- Average (AVG): This function provides the mean or average of the data values.\n",
    "- Sum: This provides a total value after the data values have been added.\n",
    "- Count: This provides the number of records.\n",
    "- Maximum (Max): This function provides the maximum value of a given set of data.\n",
    "- Minimum (Min): This provides the minimum value of a given set of data.\n",
    "- Standard deviation (std dev): This provides the dispersion or variation of the sets of data. Let’s take a simple example of a database of student marks. If the standard deviation is high, it means the average is obtained by lower number of students than usual, and the lowest and highest marks are higher.\n",
