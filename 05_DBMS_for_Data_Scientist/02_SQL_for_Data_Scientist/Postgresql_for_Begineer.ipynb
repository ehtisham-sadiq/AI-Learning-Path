    "### **What is Normalization?**\n",
    "Normalization is the process of organizing data in a database to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity. It involves dividing large tables into smaller, related tables and defining relationships between them. Normalization is achieved through a series of steps called **normal forms**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **When to Use Normalization?**\n",
    "- When designing a new database.\n",
    "- When you notice data redundancy or update anomalies in an existing database.\n",
    "- When you want to ensure data consistency and integrity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Why Use Normalization?**\n",
    "- **Reduces Redundancy**: Eliminates duplicate data, saving storage space.\n",
    "- **Improves Data Integrity**: Ensures data consistency by avoiding update anomalies.\n",
    "- **Simplifies Queries**: Makes the database easier to query and maintain.\n",

    "#### **1. First Normal Form (1NF)**\n",
    "- **Definition**: Ensures each column contains atomic (indivisible) values, and each row is unique.\n",

    "\n",
    "### **What is JSON Data?**\n",
    "PostgreSQL supports storing and querying JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) data using the `JSON` and `JSONB` data types. `JSONB` is a binary format that allows for indexing and efficient querying.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **When to Use JSON Data?**\n",
    "- When you need to store semi-structured or hierarchical data.\n",
    "- When the schema of the data is flexible or may change over time.\n",
    "- When you want to store nested data (e.g., product attributes, customer preferences).\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Why Use JSON Data?**\n",
    "- **Flexibility**: Allows you to store data without a fixed schema.\n",
    "- **Efficiency**: `JSONB` supports indexing, making queries faster.\n",
    "- **Integration**: Easily integrates with modern applications that use JSON.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **JSON vs JSONB**\n",
    "- **JSON**: Stores data as plain text. Suitable for read-heavy workloads.\n",
    "- **JSONB**: Stores data in a binary format. Supports indexing and is more efficient for querying.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Example: Storing and Querying JSON Data**\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "-- Add a JSONB column to the customers table\n",
    "ALTER TABLE customers ADD COLUMN preferences JSONB;\n",

    "#### **2. Modifying Data**\n",
    "- `jsonb_set`: Update a JSONB field.\n",
    "- `jsonb_insert`: Insert a new field into a JSONB object.\n",
    "- `jsonb_delete`: Delete a field from a JSONB object.\n",
