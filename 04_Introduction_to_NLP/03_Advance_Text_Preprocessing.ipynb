    "1. INTRODUCTION\n",
    "\n",
    "Removing suffixes by automatic means is an operation which is especially\n",
    "useful in the field of information retrieval. In a typical IR environment,\n",
    "one has a collection of documents, each described by the words in the\n",
    "document title and possibly by words in the document abstract. Ignoring the\n",
    "issue of precisely where the words originate, we can say that a document is\n",
    "represented by a vetor of words, or \\terms\\. Terms with a common stem will\n",
    "usually have similar meanings, for example:\n",
    "\n",
    "        CONNECT\n",
    "        CONNECTED\n",
    "        CONNECTING\n",
    "        CONNECTION\n",
    "        CONNECTIONS\n",
    "\n",
    "Frequently, the performance of an IR system will be improved if term groups\n",
    "such as this are conflated into a single term. This may be done by removal\n",
    "of the various suffixes -ED, -ING, -ION, IONS to leave the single term\n",
    "CONNECT. In addition, the suffix stripping process will reduce the total\n",
    "number of terms in the IR system, and hence reduce the size and complexity\n",
    "of the data in the system, which is always advantageous.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many strategies for suffix stripping have been reported in the\n",
    "literature.{(e.g. 1-6)} The nature of the task will vary considerably\n",
    "depending on whether a stem dictionary is being used, whether a suffix\n",
    "list is being used, and of course on the purpose for which the suffix\n",
    "stripping is being done. Assuming that one is not making use of a stem\n",
    "dictionary, and that the purpose of the task is to improve IR performance,\n",
    "the suffix stripping program will usually be given an explicit list of\n",
    "suffixes, and, with each suffix, the criterion under which it may be removed\n",
    "from a word to leave a valid stem. This is the approach adopted here. The\n",
    "main merits of the present program are that it is small (less than 400 lines\n",
    "of BCPL), fast (it will process a vocabulary of 10,000 different words in\n",
    "about 8.1 seconds on the IBM 370/165 at Cambridge University), and\n",
    "reasonably simple. At any rate, it is simple enough to be described in full\n",
    "as an algorithm in this paper. (The present version in BCPL is freely\n",
    "available from the author. BCPL is itself available on a wide range of\n",
    "different computers, but anyone wishing to use the program should have\n",
    "little difficulty in coding it up in other programming languages.) Given the\n",
    "speed of the program, it would be quite realistic to apply it to every word\n",
    "in a large file of continuous text, although for historical reasons we have\n",
    "found it convenient to apply it only to relatively small vocabulary lists\n",
    "derived from continuous text files.\n",
    "\n",
    "In any suffix stripping program for IR work, two points must be borne in\n",
    "mind. Firstly, the suffixes are being removed simply to improve IR\n",
    "performance, and not as a linguistic exercise. This means that it would not\n",
    "be at all obvious under what circumstances a suffix should be removed, even\n",
    "if we could exactly determine the suffixes of a word by automatic means.\n",
    "\n",
    "Perhaps the best criterion for removing suffixes from two words W1 and W2 to\n",
    "produce a single stem S, is to say that we do so if there appears to be no\n",
    "difference between the two statements `a document is about W1' and `a\n",
    "document is about W2'. So if W1=`CONNECTION' and W2=`CONNECTIONS' it seems\n",
    "very reasonable to conflate them to a single stem. But if W1=`RELATE' and\n",
    "W2=`RELATIVITY' it seems perhaps unreasonable, especially if the document\n",
    "collection is concerned with theoretical physics. (It should perhaps be\n",
    "added that RELATE and RELATIVITY \\are\\ conflated together in the algorithm\n",
    "described here.) Between these two extremes there is a continuum of\n",
    "different cases, and given two terms W1 and W2, there will be some variation\n",
    "in opinion as to whether they should be conflated, just as there is with\n",
    "deciding the relevance of some document to a query. The evaluation of the\n",
    "worth of a suffix stripping system is correspondingly difficult.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second point is that with the approach adopted here, i.e. the use of a\n",
    "suffix list with various rules, the success rate for the suffix stripping\n",
    "will be significantly less than 100% irrespective of how the process is\n",
    "evaluated. For example, if SAND and SANDER get conflated, so most probably\n",
    "will WAND and WANDER. The error here is that the -ER of WANDER has been\n",
    "treated as a suffix when in fact it is part of the stem. Equally, a suffix\n",
    "may completely alter the meaning of a word, in which case its removal is\n",
    "unhelpful. PROBE and PROBATE for example, have quite distinct meanings in\n",
    "modern English. (In fact these would not be conflated in our present\n",
    "algorithm.) There comes a stage in the development of a suffix stripping\n",
    "program where the addition of more rules to increase the performance in one\n",
    "area of the vocabulary causes an equal degradation of performance elsewhere.\n",
    "Unless this phenomenon is noticed in time, it is very easy for the program\n",
    "to become much more complex than is really necessary. It is also easy to\n",
    "give undue emphasis to cases which appear to be important, but which turn ut\n",
    "to be rather rare. For example, cases in which the root of a word changes\n",
    "with the addition of a suffix, as in DECEIVE/DECEPTION, RESUME/RESUMPTION,\n",
    "INDEX/INDICES occur much more rarely in real vocabularies than one might at\n",
    "first suppose. In view of the error rate that must in any case be expected,\n",
    "it did not seem worthwhile to try and cope with these cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is not obvious that the simplicity of the present program is any demerit.\n",
    "In a test on the well-known Cranfield 200 collection{7} it gave an\n",
    "improvement in retrieval performance when compared with a very much more\n",
    "elaborate program which has been in use in IR research in Cambridge since\n",
    "1971{(2,6)}. The test was done as follows: the words of the titles and\n",
    "abstracts in the documents were passed through the earlier suffix stripping\n",
    "system, and the resultis stems were used to index the documents. The words\n",
    "of the queries were reduced to stems in the same way, and the documents were\n",
    "ranked for each query using term coordination matching of query against\n",
    "document. From these rankings, recall and precision values were obtained\n",
    "using the standard recall cutoff method. The entire process was then\n",
    "repeated using the suffix stripping system described in this paper, and the\n",
    "results were as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "        earlier system        present system\n",
    "        --------------        --------------\n",
    "      precision  recall     precision  recall\n",
    "           0      57.24          0      58.60\n",

    "\n",
    "Cleary, the performance is not very different. The important point is that\n",
    "the earlier, more elaborate system certainly performs no better than the\n",
    "present, simple system.\n",

    "(This test was done by prof. C.J. van Rijsbergen.)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. THE ALGORITHM\n",
    "\n",
    "To present the suffix stripping algorithm in its entirety we will need a few\n",
    "difinitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "A \\consonant\\ in a word is a letter other than A, E, I, O or U, and other\n",
    "than Y preceded by a consonant. (The fact that the term `consonant' is\n",
    "defined to some extent in terms of itself does not make it ambiguous.) So in\n",
    "TOY the consonants are T and Y, and in SYZYGY they are S, Z and G. If a\n",
    "letter is not a consonant it is a \\vowel\\.\n",
    "\n",
    "A consonant will be denoted by c, a vowel by v. A list ccc... of length\n",
    "greater than 0 will be denoted by C, and a list vvv... of length greater\n",
    "than 0 will be denoted by V. Any word, or part of a word, therefore has one\n",
    "of the four forms:\n",
    "\n",
    "    CVCV ... C\n",
    "    CVCV ... V\n",
    "    VCVC ... C\n",
    "    VCVC ... V\n",
    "\n",
    "These may all be represented by the single form\n",
    "\n",
    "    [C]VCVC ... [V]\n",
    "\n",
    "where the square brackets denote arbitrary presence of their contents.\n",
    "Using (VC){m} to denote VC repeated m times, this may again be written as\n",
    "\n",
    "    [C](VC){m}[V].\n",
    "\n",
    "m will be called the \\measure\\ of any word or word part when represented in\n",
    "this form. The case m = 0 covers the null word. Here are some examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "    m=0    TR,  EE,  TREE,  Y,  BY.\n",
    "    m=1    TROUBLE,  OATS,  TREES,  IVY.\n",
    "    m=2    TROUBLES,  PRIVATE,  OATEN,  ORRERY.\n",
    "\n",
    "The \\rules\\ for removing a suffix will be given in the form\n",
    "\n",
    "    (condition) S1 -> S2\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that if a word ends with the suffix S1, and the stem before S1\n",
    "satisfies the given condition, S1 is replaced by S2. The condition is\n",
    "usually given in terms of m, e.g.\n",
    "\n",
    "    (m > 1) EMENT ->\n",
    "\n",
    "Here S1 is `EMENT' and S2 is null. This would map REPLACEMENT to REPLAC,\n",
    "since REPLAC is a word part for which m = 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `condition' part may also contain the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "*S  - the stem ends with S (and similarly for the other letters).\n",
    "\n",
    "*v* - the stem contains a vowel.\n",
    "\n",
    "*d  - the stem ends with a double consonant (e.g. -TT, -SS).\n",
    "\n",
    "*o  - the stem ends cvc, where the second c is not W, X or Y (e.g.\n",
    "       -WIL, -HOP).\n",
    "\n",
    "And the condition part may also contain expressions with \\and\\, \\or\\ and\n",
    "\\not\\, so that\n",
    "\n",
    "    (m>1 and (*S or *T))\n",
    "\n",
    "tests for a stem with m>1 ending in S or T, while\n",
    "\n",
    "    (*d and not (*L or *S or *Z))\n",
    "\n",
    "tests for a stem ending witha double consonant other than L, S or Z.\n",
    "Elaborate conditions like this are required only rarely.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a set of rules written beneath each other, only one is obeyed, and this\n",
    "will be the one with the longest matching S1 for the given word. For\n",
    "example, with\n",
    "\n",
    "    SSES -> SS\n",
    "    IES  -> I\n",

    "    S    ->\n",

    "to CARE (S1=`S').\n",
    "\n",
    "In the rules below, examples of their application, successful or otherwise,\n",
