    "# 1. INTRODUCTION\n",
    "\n",
    "# Removing suffixes by automatic means is an operation which is especially\n",
    "# useful in the field of information retrieval. In a typical IR environment,\n",
    "# one has a collection of documents, each described by the words in the\n",
    "# document title and possibly by words in the document abstract. Ignoring the\n",
    "# issue of precisely where the words originate, we can say that a document is\n",
    "# represented by a vetor of words, or \\terms\\. Terms with a common stem will\n",
    "# usually have similar meanings, for example:\n",
    "\n",
    "#         CONNECT\n",
    "#         CONNECTED\n",
    "#         CONNECTING\n",
    "#         CONNECTION\n",
    "#         CONNECTIONS\n",
    "\n",
    "# Frequently, the performance of an IR system will be improved if term groups\n",
    "# such as this are conflated into a single term. This may be done by removal\n",
    "# of the various suffixes -ED, -ING, -ION, IONS to leave the single term\n",
    "# CONNECT. In addition, the suffix stripping process will reduce the total\n",
    "# number of terms in the IR system, and hence reduce the size and complexity\n",
    "# of the data in the system, which is always advantageous.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Many strategies for suffix stripping have been reported in the\n",
    "# literature.{(e.g. 1-6)} The nature of the task will vary considerably\n",
    "# depending on whether a stem dictionary is being used, whether a suffix\n",
    "# list is being used, and of course on the purpose for which the suffix\n",
    "# stripping is being done. Assuming that one is not making use of a stem\n",
    "# dictionary, and that the purpose of the task is to improve IR performance,\n",
    "# the suffix stripping program will usually be given an explicit list of\n",
    "# suffixes, and, with each suffix, the criterion under which it may be removed\n",
    "# from a word to leave a valid stem. This is the approach adopted here. The\n",
    "# main merits of the present program are that it is small (less than 400 lines\n",
    "# of BCPL), fast (it will process a vocabulary of 10,000 different words in\n",
    "# about 8.1 seconds on the IBM 370/165 at Cambridge University), and\n",
    "# reasonably simple. At any rate, it is simple enough to be described in full\n",
    "# as an algorithm in this paper. (The present version in BCPL is freely\n",
    "# available from the author. BCPL is itself available on a wide range of\n",
    "# different computers, but anyone wishing to use the program should have\n",
    "# little difficulty in coding it up in other programming languages.) Given the\n",
    "# speed of the program, it would be quite realistic to apply it to every word\n",
    "# in a large file of continuous text, although for historical reasons we have\n",
    "# found it convenient to apply it only to relatively small vocabulary lists\n",
    "# derived from continuous text files.\n",
    "\n",
    "# In any suffix stripping program for IR work, two points must be borne in\n",
    "# mind. Firstly, the suffixes are being removed simply to improve IR\n",
    "# performance, and not as a linguistic exercise. This means that it would not\n",
    "# be at all obvious under what circumstances a suffix should be removed, even\n",
    "# if we could exactly determine the suffixes of a word by automatic means.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Perhaps the best criterion for removing suffixes from two words W1 and W2 to\n",
    "# produce a single stem S, is to say that we do so if there appears to be no\n",
    "# difference between the two statements `a document is about W1' and `a\n",
    "# document is about W2'. So if W1=`CONNECTION' and W2=`CONNECTIONS' it seems\n",
    "# very reasonable to conflate them to a single stem. But if W1=`RELATE' and\n",
    "# W2=`RELATIVITY' it seems perhaps unreasonable, especially if the document\n",
    "# collection is concerned with theoretical physics. (It should perhaps be\n",
    "# added that RELATE and RELATIVITY \\are\\ conflated together in the algorithm\n",
    "# described here.) Between these two extremes there is a continuum of\n",
    "# different cases, and given two terms W1 and W2, there will be some variation\n",
    "# in opinion as to whether they should be conflated, just as there is with\n",
    "# deciding the relevance of some document to a query. The evaluation of the\n",
    "# worth of a suffix stripping system is correspondingly difficult.\n",
    "\n",
    "# The second point is that with the approach adopted here, i.e. the use of a\n",
    "# suffix list with various rules, the success rate for the suffix stripping\n",
    "# will be significantly less than 100% irrespective of how the process is\n",
    "# evaluated. For example, if SAND and SANDER get conflated, so most probably\n",
    "# will WAND and WANDER. The error here is that the -ER of WANDER has been\n",
    "# treated as a suffix when in fact it is part of the stem. Equally, a suffix\n",
    "# may completely alter the meaning of a word, in which case its removal is\n",
    "# unhelpful. PROBE and PROBATE for example, have quite distinct meanings in\n",
    "# modern English. (In fact these would not be conflated in our present\n",
    "# algorithm.) There comes a stage in the development of a suffix stripping\n",
    "# program where the addition of more rules to increase the performance in one\n",
    "# area of the vocabulary causes an equal degradation of performance elsewhere.\n",
    "# Unless this phenomenon is noticed in time, it is very easy for the program\n",
    "# to become much more complex than is really necessary. It is also easy to\n",
    "# give undue emphasis to cases which appear to be important, but which turn ut\n",
    "# to be rather rare. For example, cases in which the root of a word changes\n",
    "# with the addition of a suffix, as in DECEIVE/DECEPTION, RESUME/RESUMPTION,\n",
    "# INDEX/INDICES occur much more rarely in real vocabularies than one might at\n",
    "# first suppose. In view of the error rate that must in any case be expected,\n",
    "# it did not seem worthwhile to try and cope with these cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "# It is not obvious that the simplicity of the present program is any demerit.\n",
    "# In a test on the well-known Cranfield 200 collection{7} it gave an\n",
    "# improvement in retrieval performance when compared with a very much more\n",
    "# elaborate program which has been in use in IR research in Cambridge since\n",
    "# 1971{(2,6)}. The test was done as follows: the words of the titles and\n",
    "# abstracts in the documents were passed through the earlier suffix stripping\n",
    "# system, and the resultis stems were used to index the documents. The words\n",
    "# of the queries were reduced to stems in the same way, and the documents were\n",
    "# ranked for each query using term coordination matching of query against\n",
    "# document. From these rankings, recall and precision values were obtained\n",
    "# using the standard recall cutoff method. The entire process was then\n",
    "# repeated using the suffix stripping system described in this paper, and the\n",
